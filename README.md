Plots is a plotting API and toolset.  My goals with the package are:

- **Powerful**.  Do more with less.  Complex visualizations become easy.
- **Intuitive**.  Stop reading so much documentation.  Commands should "just work".
- **Concise**.  Less code means fewer mistakes and more efficient development/analysis.
- **Flexible**.  Produce your favorite plots from your favorite package, but quicker and simpler.
- **Consistent**.  Don't commit to one graphics package, use the same code everywhere.
- **Lightweight**.  Very few dependencies.
- **Smart**. Attempts to figure out what you **want** it to do... not just what you **tell** it.

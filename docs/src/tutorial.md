# [Tutorial](@id tutorial)

This is a guide for getting you up and running with Plots.jl. Its main goal is
to introduce you to the terminology used in the package, how to use Plots.jl in
common use cases, and put you in a position to easily understand the rest of
the manual. It is recommended that the code examples be followed inside
the REPL or an interactive notebook.

## Basic Plotting: Line Plots

After you have installed Plots.jl via `Pkg.add("Plots")`, the first step is to 
initialize the package. Depending on your computer, this will take a few seconds:

```@example tutorial
using Plots
```

To start, let's plot some trigonometric functions. For the `x` coordinates, we can
create a range from 0 to 10 of, say, 100 elements. For the `y` coordinates, we 
can create a vector by evaluating `sin(x)` in an element-wise fashion. To do this 
in Julia, we insert a dot right after the function call. Finally, we use `plot()`
to plot the line.

```@example tutorial
x = range(0, 10, length=100)
y = sin.(x)
plot(x, y)
```

The plot is displayed in a plot pane, a stand-alone window or the browser,
depending on the environment and backend (see [below](@ref plotting-backends)).

If this is your first plot of the session and it takes a while to show up,
this is normal; this latency is called the "time to first plot" problem (or `TTFP`), 
and subsequent plots will be fast. Because of the way Julia works under
the hood, this is a difficult problem to solve, but much progress has been made
in the past few years to reduce this compilation time.

In Plots.jl, every column is a **series**, a set of related points which
form lines, surfaces, or other plotting primitives. We can plot multiple
lines by plotting a matrix of values where each column is interpreted as a
separate line. Below, `[y1 y2]` forms a 100x2 matrix (100 elements, 2 columns).

```@example tutorial
x = range(0, 10, length=100)
y1 = sin.(x)
y2 = cos.(x)
plot(x, [y1 y2])
```

Additionally, we can add more lines by mutating the plot object. This is done
by the `plot!` command, where the `!` denotes that the command is modifying
the current plot.
You'll notice that we also use an `@.` macro. This is a convenience macro
that inserts dots for every function call to the right of the macro, ensuring 
that the entire expression is to be evaluated in an element-wise manner. 
If we inputted the dots manually, we would need three of them for the sine, 
exponent, and subtraction, and the resulting code would be less readable.

```@example tutorial
y3 = @. sin(x)^2 - 1/2   # equivalent to y3 = sin.(x).^2 .- 1/2
plot!(x, y3)
```

Note that we could have done the same as above using an explicit plot variable,
which we call `p`:

```@example tutorial
x = range(0, 10, length=100)
y1 = sin.(x)
y2 = cos.(x)
p = plot(x, [y1 y2])

y3 = @. sin(x)^2 - 1/2
plot!(p, x, y3)
```

In cases where the plot variable is omitted, Plots.jl uses the global
`Plots.CURRENT_PLOT` automatically.

### Saving Figures

Saving plots is done by the `savefig` command. For example:

```julia
savefig("myplot.png")      # saves the CURRENT_PLOT as a .png
savefig(p, "myplot.pdf")   # saves the plot from p as a .pdf vector graphic
```

There also exist convenience functions `png`, `Plots.pdf` and other 
unexported helpers. With these, the extension is omitted from the filename. 
The following is equivalent to the above code:

```julia
png("myplot")
Plots.pdf(p, "myplot")
```

More information about outputting figures can be found in the 
[Output](@ref output) section of the Manual.

## Plot Attributes

In the previous section we made plots... we're done, right? No! We need to style
our plots. In Plots.jl, the modifiers to plots are called **attributes**, which
are documented at the [attributes page](@ref attributes). Plots.jl follows two 
simple rules with data and attributes: 

* Positional arguments correspond to input data
* Keyword arguments correspond to attributes

So something like `plot(x, y, z)` is three-dimensional data for 3D plots with no
attributes, while `plot(x, y, attribute=value)` is two-dimensional data with 
one attribute assigned to some value.

As an example, we can change the line width using `linewidth` (or its alias `lw`), 
change the legend's labels using `label`, and add a title with `title`. Notice how
`["sin(x)" "cos(x)"]` has the same number of columns as the data.
Additionally, since the line width is being attributed to `[y1 y2]`, both lines 
will be affected by the assigned value. Let's apply all of this to our previous 
plot:

```@example tutorial
x = range(0, 10, length=100)
y1 = sin.(x)
y2 = cos.(x)
plot(x, [y1 y2], title="Trigonometric functions", label=["sin(x)" "cos(x)"], linewidth=3)
```

Every attribute can also be applied by mutating the plot with a
modifier function. Some attributes have their own dedicated modifier functions,
while others can be accessed through `plot!(attribute=value)`.
For example, the `xlabel` attribute adds a label for the 
x-axis. We can specify it in the plot command with `xlabel=...`, 
or we can use the modifier function below to add it after the plot has already 
been generated. It's up to you to decide which is better for code readability.

```julia
xlabel!("x")
```

Every modifier function is the name of the attribute followed by `!`. This will
implicitly use the global `Plots.CURRENT_PLOT`. We can apply it to
other plot objects via `attribute!(p, value)`, where `p` is the name
of the plot object that wants to be modified.

Let's use keywords and modifier functions interchangeably to perform some 
common modifications to our example, listed below. You'll notice that for the 
attributes `ls` and `legend`, the values include a colon `:`.
The colon denotes a symbol in Julia. They are commonly used for values of 
attributes in Plots.jl, along with strings and numbers. 

* Labels for the individual lines, seen in the legend
* Line widths (we'll use the alias `lw` instead of `linewidth`)
* Line styles (we'll use the alias `ls` instead of `linestyle`)
* Legend position (outside the plot, as the default would clutter the plot)
* Legend columns (3, to better use the horizontal space)
* X-limits to go from `0` to `2pi`
* Plot title and axis labels

```@example tutorial
x = range(0, 10, length=100)
y1 = sin.(x)
y2 = cos.(x)
y3 = @. sin(x)^2 - 1/2

plot(x, [y1 y2], label=["sin(x)" "cos(x)"], lw=[2 1])
plot!(x, y3, label="sin(x)^2 - 1/2", lw=3, ls=:dot)
plot!(legend=:outerbottom, legendcolumns=3)
xlims!(0, 2pi)
title!("Trigonometric functions") 
xlabel!("x")
ylabel!("y")
```

Note that `y3` is being plotted as a dotted line. This is distinct from a
scatter plot of the data.

### Logarithmic Scale Plots

Sometimes data needs to be plotted across orders of magnitude. The attributes
`xscale` and `yscale` can be set to `:log10` in this case. They can also be
set to `:identity` to keep them linear-scale.
Care should be taken to ensure that the data and limits are positive. 

```@example tutorial
x = 10 .^ range(0, 4, length=100)
y = @. 1/(1+x)

plot(x, y, label="1/(1+x)")
plot!(xscale=:log10, yscale=:log10, minorgrid=true)
xlims!(1e+0, 1e+4)
ylims!(1e-5, 1e+0)
title!("Log-log plot") 
xlabel!("x")
ylabel!("y")
```

More information about attributes can be found in the 
[Attributes](@ref attributes) section of the Manual.

### LaTeX Equation Strings

Plots.jl works with LaTeXStrings.jl, a package that allows the user to type
LaTeX equations in string literals. To install this, type in
`Pkg.add("LaTeXStrings")`. The easiest way to use it is to prepend `L` to a
LaTeX-formatted string. If the string is a mix between normal text and LaTeX
equations, insert dollar signs `$` as needed.

```@example tutorial
using LaTeXStrings

x = 10 .^ range(0, 4, length=100)
y = @. 1/(1+x)

plot(x, y, label=L"\frac{1}{1+x}")
plot!(xscale=:log10, yscale=:log10, minorgrid=true)
xlims!(1e+0, 1e+4)
ylims!(1e-5, 1e+0)
title!(L"Log-log plot of $\frac{1}{1+x}$") 
xlabel!(L"x")
ylabel!(L"y")
```

## Changing Series Type: Scatter Plots

At this point you know about line plots, but don't you want to plot your data
in other ways? In Plots.jl, these other ways of plotting a series is called a
**series type**. A line is one series type. However, a scatter plot is another
series type which is commonly used. 

Let's start with the sine function again, but this time, we'll define a vector
called `y_noisy` that adds some randomness. 
We can change the series type using the `seriestype` attribute.

```@example tutorial
x = range(0, 10, length=100)
y = sin.(x)
y_noisy = @. sin(x) + 0.1*randn()

plot(x, y, label="sin(x)")
plot!(x, y_noisy, seriestype=:scatter, label="data")
```

For each built-in series type, there is a shorthand function for directly
calling that series type which matches its name. It handles
attributes just the same as the `plot` command, and it has a mutating form which
ends in `!`. For example, we can write the last line as:

```julia
scatter!(x, y_noisy, label="data")
```

The series types which are available are dependent on the backend, and are
documented on the [Supported Attributes page](@ref supported). As we will describe
later, other libraries can add new series types using **recipes**.

Scatter plots will have some common attributes related to the markers. Here
is an example of the same plot, but with some attributes fleshed out to make
the plot more presentable. Many aliases are used for brevity, and the list
below is by no means exhaustive.

* `lc` for `linecolor`
* `lw` for `linewidth`
* `mc` for `markercolor`
* `ms` for `markersize`
* `ma` for `markeralpha`

```@example tutorial
x = range(0, 10, length=100)
y = sin.(x)
y_noisy = @. sin(x) + 0.1*randn()

plot(x, y, label="sin(x)", lc=:black, lw=2)
scatter!(x, y_noisy, label="data", mc=:red, ms=2, ma=0.5)
plot!(legend=:bottomleft)
title!("Sine with noise")
xlabel!("x")
ylabel!("y")
```

## [Plotting Backends](@id plotting-backends)

Plots.jl is a plotting metapackage: it's an interface over many different plotting libraries.
What Plots.jl is actually doing is interpreting your commands and then
generating the plots using another plotting library, called the **backend**. 
The nice thing about this is that you can use many different plotting libraries
all with the Plots.jl syntax, and we'll see in a little bit that Plots.jl 
adds new features to each of these libraries!

When we started plotting above, our plot used the default backend GR. 
However, let's say we want a different plotting backend which will plot into 
a nice GUI or into the plot pane of VS Code. To do this, we'll need a backend 
which is compatible with these features. Some common backends for this are 
PythonPlot and Plotly. For example, to install PythonPlot, simply type the command 
`Pkg.add("PythonPlot")` into the REPL; to install Plotly, type
`Pkg.add("PlotlyJS")`.

We can specifically choose the backend we are plotting into by using the name 
of the backend in all lowercase as a function. Let's plot the example from 
above using Plotly and then GR:

```@example tutorial
plotlyjs()   # set the backend to Plotly

x = range(0, 10, length=100)
y = sin.(x)
y_noisy = @. sin(x) + 0.1*randn()

# this plots into a standalone window via Plotly
plot(x, y, label="sin(x)", lc=:black, lw=2)
scatter!(x, y_noisy, label="data", mc=:red, ms=2, ma=0.5)
plot!(legend=:bottomleft)
title!("Sine with noise, plotted with Plotly")
xlabel!("x")
ylabel!("y")
png("plotlyjs_tutorial")  #hide
```
![](plotlyjs_tutorial.png)

```@example tutorial
gr()   # set the backend to GR

# this plots using GR
plot(x, y, label="sin(x)", lc=:black, lw=2)
scatter!(x, y_noisy, label="data", mc=:red, ms=2, ma=0.5)
plot!(legend=:bottomleft)
title!("Sine with noise, plotted with GR")
xlabel!("x")
ylabel!("y")
```

Each plotting backend has a very different feel. Some have interactivity, some
are faster and can deal with huge numbers of datapoints, and some can do
3D plots. Some backends like GR can save to vector graphics and PDFs, while 
others like Plotly can only save to PNGs. 

For more information on backends, see the [backends page](@ref backends). 
For examples of plots from the various backends, see the Examples section.

## Plotting in Scripts

At the start of the tutorial, we recommended following along the code examples 
in an interactive session for the following reason: try adding those same 
plotting commands to a script. Now call the script... and the plot doesn't 
show up? This is because Julia in interactive use through the REPL calls `display` on every 
variable that is returned by a command without a semicolon `;`. In each case 
above, the interactive usage was automatically calling `display` on the returned
plot objects.

In a script, Julia does not do automatic displays, which is why `;` is not
necessary. However, if we would like to display our plots in a script, this
means we just need to add the `display` call. For example:

```julia
display(plot(x, y))
```

Alternatively, we could call `gui()` at the end to do the same thing.
Finally, if we have a plot object `p`, we can type `display(p)` to 
display the plot.

## Combining Multiple Plots as Subplots

We can combine multiple plots together as subplots using **layouts**.
There are many methods for doing this, and we will show two simple methods
for generating simple layouts. More advanced layouts are shown in the
[Layouts page](@ref layouts).

The first method is to define a layout which will split a series. The `layout`
command takes in a 2-tuple `layout=(N, M)` which builds an NxM grid of plots,
and it will automatically split a series to be in each plot. For example, if we 
type `layout=(3, 1)` on a plot with three series, then we will get three rows of 
plots, each with one series in it.

Let's define some functions and plot them in separate plots. Since there's only
one series in each plot, we'll also remove the legend in each of the plots 
using `legend=false`.

```@example tutorial
x = range(0, 10, length=100)
y1 = @. exp(-0.1x) * cos(4x)
y2 = @. exp(-0.3x) * cos(4x)
y3 = @. exp(-0.5x) * cos(4x)
plot(x, [y1 y2 y3], layout=(3, 1), legend=false)
```

We can also use layouts on plots of plot objects. For example, we can generate
four separate plots and make a single plot that combines them into a 2x2 grid.

```@example tutorial
x = range(0, 10, length=100)
y1 = @. exp(-0.1x) * cos(4x)
y2 = @. exp(-0.3x) * cos(4x)
y3 = @. exp(-0.1x)
y4 = @. exp(-0.3x)
y = [y1 y2 y3 y4]

p1 = plot(x, y)
p2 = plot(x, y, title="Title 2", lw=3)
p3 = scatter(x, y, ms=2, ma=0.5, xlabel="xlabel 3")
p4 = scatter(x, y, title="Title 4", ms=2, ma=0.2)
plot(p1, p2, p3, p4, layout=(2,2), legend=false)
```

Note that the attributes in the individual plots are applied to those
individual plots, while the attribute `legend=false` in the final `plot` 
call is applied to all of the subplots.

## Plot Recipes and Recipe Libraries

You now know all of the basic terminology of Plots.jl and can roam the
documentation freely to become a plotting master. However, there is one
thing left: **recipes**. Plotting recipes are extensions to the Plots.jl
framework. They add:

1. New `plot` commands via **user recipes**.
2. Default interpretations of Julia types as plotting data via **type recipes**.
3. New functions for generating plots via **plot recipes**.
4. New series types via **series recipes**.

Writing your own recipes is an advanced topic described on the
[recipes page](@ref recipes). Instead, we will introduce the ways that one uses
a recipe.

Recipes are included in many recipe libraries. Two fundamental recipe libraries
are [PlotRecipes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/PlotRecipes.jl) and
[StatsPlots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/StatsPlots.jl). Let's look into
StatsPlots.jl. StatsPlots.jl adds a bunch of recipes, but the ones we'll focus
on are:

1. It adds a type recipe for `Distribution`s.
2. It adds a plot recipe for marginal histograms.
3. It adds a bunch of new statistical plot series.

Besides recipes, StatsPlots.jl also provides a specialized macro `@df` from plotting 
directly from data tables.

### Using User Recipes

A user recipe says how to interpret plotting commands on a new data type.
In this case, StatsPlots.jl has a macro `@df` which allows you to plot
a `DataFrame` directly by using the column names. Let's build a `DataFrame`
with columns `a`, `b`, and `c`, and tell Plots.jl to use `a` as the `x` axis
and plot the series defined by columns `b` and `c`:

```@example tutorial
# Pkg.add("StatsPlots")
# required for the dataframe user recipe
using StatsPlots 

# now let's create the dataframe
using DataFrames
df = DataFrame(a=1:10, b=10*rand(10), c=10*rand(10))

# plot the dataframe by declaring the points by the column names
# x = :a, y = [:b :c] (notice that y has two columns!)
@df df plot(:a, [:b :c])
```

There's not much you have to do here: all of the commands from before
(attributes, series types, etc.) will still work on this data:

```@example tutorial
# x = :a, y = :b
@df df scatter(:a, :b, title="My DataFrame Scatter Plot!") 
```

### Using a Type Recipe

In addition, StatsPlots.jl extends Distributions.jl by adding a type recipe
for its distribution types, so they can be directly interpreted as plotting
data:

```@example tutorial
using Distributions
plot(Normal(3, 5), lw=3)
```

Type recipes are a very convenient way to plot a specialized type which
requires no more intervention!

### Using Plot Recipes

StatsPlots.jl adds the `marginhist` multiplot via a plot recipe. For our data,
we will pull in the famous `iris` dataset from RDatasets:

```@example tutorial
# Pkg.add("RDatasets")
using RDatasets, StatsPlots
iris = dataset("datasets", "iris")
@df iris marginalhist(:PetalLength, :PetalWidth)
```

Here, `iris` is a DataFrame; using the `@df` macro on `DataFrame`s described above,
we give `marginalhist(x, y)` the data from the `PetalLength` and the `PetalWidth`
columns.

Notice that this is more than a series since it generates multiple series 
(i.e. there are multiple plots due to the hists on the top and right). 
Thus a plot recipe is not just a series, but also something like a new 
`plot` command.

### Using Series Recipes

StatsPlots.jl also introduces new series recipes. The key is that you don't have
to do anything differently. After `using StatsPlots`, you can simply use those
new series recipes as though they were built into the plotting libraries. Let's
use the Violin plot on some random data:

```@example tutorial
y = rand(100, 4)
violin(["Series 1" "Series 2" "Series 3" "Series 4"], y, legend=false)
```

We can add a `boxplot` on top using the same mutation commands as before:

```@example tutorial
boxplot!(["Series 1" "Series 2" "Series 3" "Series 4"], y, legend=false)
```

## Additional Addons To Try

Given the easy extendability of Plots.jl, there are many other things you can
try. Here's a short list of very usable addons to check out:

- [PlotThemes.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/PlotThemes.jl) allows you to
  change the color scheme of your plots. For example, `theme(:dark)` adds a
  dark theme.
- [StatsPlots.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/StatsPlots.jl) adds functionality 
  for visualizations of statistical analysis
- The [ecosystem page](@ref ecosystem) shows many other packages which have recipes
  and extend Plots.jl's functionality.

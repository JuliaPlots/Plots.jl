# [Output](@id output)


**A Plot is only displayed when returned** (a semicolon will suppress the return), or if explicitly displayed with `display(plt)`, `gui()`, or by adding `show = true` to your plot command.


!!! tip
    You can have MATLAB-like interactive behavior by setting the default value: default(show = true)

### Standalone window

Calling `gui(plt)` will open a standalone window.  `gui()`, like `plot!(...)`, applies to the "current" Plot.  Returning a Plot object to the REPL is like calling `gui(plt)`.


### Jupyter / IJulia

Plots are shown inline when returned to a cell.  The default output format is `svg` for backends that support it.
This can be changed by the `html_output_format` attribute, with alias `fmt`:

```julia
plot(rand(10), fmt = :png)
```

### Juno / Atom

Plots are shown in the Atom PlotPane when possible, either when returned to the console or to an inline code block. At any time, the plot can be opened in a standalone window using the `gui()` command. 
The PlotPane can be disabled in Juno's settings.

### savefig / format

Plots support 2 different versions per save-command.
Command `savefig` chooses file type automatically based on the file extension.

```julia
savefig(filename_string) # save the most recent fig as filename_string (such as "output.png")
savefig(plot_ref, filename_string) # save the fig referenced by plot_ref as filename_string (such as "output.png")
```

In addition, `Plots` exports the convenience function `png(filename::AbstractString)`.
Other functions such as `Plots.pdf` or `Plots.svg` remain unexported, since they might
conflict with exports from other packages.
In this case the string fn containing the filename does not need a file extension.

```julia
png(filename_string) # save the current fig as png with filename filename_string (such as "output.png")
png(plot_ref, filename_string) # save the fig referenced by plot_ref as png with filename filename_string (such as "output.png")
```

#### File formats supported by most graphical backends

 - png (default output format for `savefig`, if no file extension is given)
 - svg
 - PDF
 
When not using `savefig`, the default output format depends on the environment (e.g., when using IJulia/Jupyter).

#### Supported output file formats

Note:   not all backends support every output file format !
A simple table showing which format is supported by which backend

| format | backends                                                             |
| :----- | :------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| eps    | inspectdr, plotlyjs, pythonplot                                      |
| html   | plotly,  plotlyjs                                                    |
| json   | plotly, plotlyjs                                                     |
| pdf    | gr, plotlyjs, pythonplot, pgfplotsx, inspectdr, gaston               |
| png    | gr, plotlyjs, pythonplot, pgfplotsx, inspectdr, gaston, unicodeplots |
| ps     | gr, pythonplot                                                       |
| svg    | gr, inspectdr, pgfplotsx, plotlyjs, pythonplot, gaston               |
| tex    | pgfplotsx, pythonplot                                                |
| text   | hdf5, unicodeplots                                                   |

Supported file formats can be written to an IO stream via, for example, `png(myplot, pipebuffer::IO)`, so the image file can be passed via a PipeBuffer to other functions, eg. `Cairo.read_from_png(pipebuffer::IO)`.

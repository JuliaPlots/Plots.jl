# [Input Data](@id input-data)

Part of the power of Plots lies is in the many combinations of allowed input data.
You shouldn't spend your time transforming and massaging your data into a specific format.
Let Plots do that for you.

There are a few rules to remember, and you'll be a power user in no time.

## Inputs are arguments, not keywords

The `plot` function has several methods:
`plot(y)`: treats the input as values for the `y`-axis and yields a unit-range as `x`-values.
`plot(x, y)`: creates a 2D plot
`plot(x, y, z)`: creates a 3D plot

The reason lies in the flexibility of Julia's multiple dispatch, where every combination of input types
can have unique behavior, when desired.

## [Columns are series](@id columns-are-series)

In most cases, passing a (`n` × `m`) matrix of values (numbers, etc) will create `m` series, each with `n` data points.  This follows a consistent rule… vectors apply to a series, matrices apply to many series.  This rule carries into keyword arguments.  `scatter(rand(10,4), markershape = [:circle, :rect])` will create 4 series, each assigned the markershape vector [:circle,:rect].  However, `scatter(rand(10,4), markershape = [:circle :rect])` will create 4 series, with series 1 and 3 having markers shaped as `:circle` and series 2 and 4 having markers shaped as `:rect` (i.e. as squares).  The difference is that in the first example, it is a length-2 column vector, and in the second example it is a (1 × 2) row vector (a Matrix).

The flexibility and power of this can be illustrated by the following piece of code:
```@example input_data
using Plots

# 10 data points in 4 series
xs = range(0, 2π, length = 10)
data = [sin.(xs) cos.(xs) 2sin.(xs) 2cos.(xs)]

# We put labels in a row vector: applies to each series
labels = ["Apples" "Oranges" "Hats" "Shoes"]

# Marker shapes in a column vector: applies to data points
markershapes = [:circle, :star5]

# Marker colors in a matrix: applies to series and data points
markercolors = [
    :green :orange :black :purple
    :red   :yellow :brown :white
]

plot(
    xs,
    data,
    label = labels,
    shape = markershapes,
    color = markercolors,
    markersize = 10
)
```
This example plots the four series with different labels, marker shapes, and marker colors by combining row and column vectors to decorate the data.

The following example illustrates how Plots.jl handles: an array of matrices, an array of arrays of arrays and an array of tuples of arrays.
```@example input_data
x1, x2 = [1, 0],  [2, 3]    # vectors
y1, y2 = [4, 5],  [6, 7]    # vectors
m1, m2 = [x1 y1], [x2 y2]   # 2x2 matrices

plot([m1, m2])              # array of matrices -> 4 series, plots each matrix column, x assumed to be integer count
plot([[x1,y1], [x2,y2]])    # array of array of arrays -> 4 series, plots each individual array, x assumed to be integer count 
plot([(x1,y1), (x2,y2)])    # array of tuples of arrays -> 2 series, plots each tuple as new series
```

## Unconnected Data within same groups

As shown in the examples, you can plot a single polygon by using a single call to `plot` using the `:path` line type. You can use several calls to `plot` to draw several polygons.

Now, let's say you're plotting `n` polygons grouped into `g` groups, with `n` > `g`. While you can use `plot` to draw separate polygons with each call, you cannot group two separate plots back into a single group. You'll end up with `n` groups in the legend, rather than `g` groups.

To adress this, you can use `NaN` as a path separator. A call to `plot` would then draw one path with disjoints The following code draws `n=4` rectangles in `g=2` groups.

```@example input_data
using Plots
plotlyjs()

function rectangle_from_coords(xb,yb,xt,yt)
    [
        xb  yb
        xt  yb
        xt  yt
        xb  yt
        xb  yb
        NaN NaN
    ]
end

some_rects=[
    rectangle_from_coords(1, 1, 5, 5)
    rectangle_from_coords(10, 10, 15, 15)
]
other_rects=[
    rectangle_from_coords(1, 10, 5, 15)
    rectangle_from_coords(10, 1, 15, 5)
]

plot(some_rects[:,1], some_rects[:,2], label = "some group")
plot!(other_rects[:,1], other_rects[:,2], label = "other group")
png("input_data_1") # hide
```

## DataFrames support

Using the [StatsPlots](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/StatsPlots.jl) extension package, you can pass a `DataFrame` as the first argument (similar to Gadfly or R's ggplot2).  For data fields or certain attributes (such as `group`) a symbol will be replaced with the corresponding column(s) of the `DataFrame`.  Additionally, the column name might be used as the   An example:

```@example input_data
using StatsPlots, RDatasets
gr()
iris = dataset("datasets", "iris")
@df iris scatter(
    :SepalLength,
    :SepalWidth,
    group = :Species,
    m = (0.5, [:+ :h :star7], 12),
    bg = RGB(0.2, 0.2, 0.2)
)
```

## Functions

Functions can typically be used in place of input data, and they will be mapped as needed. 2D and 3D parametric plots can also be created, and ranges can be given as vectors or min/max.  For example, here are alternative methods to create the same plot:

```@example input_data
using Plots
tmin = 0
tmax = 4π
tvec = range(tmin, tmax, length = 100)

plot(sin.(tvec), cos.(tvec))
```
```@example input_data
plot(sin, cos, tvec)
```
```@example input_data
plot(sin, cos, tmin, tmax)
```

Vectors of functions are allowed as well (one series per function).

## Images

Images can be directly added to plots by using the [Images.jl](https://github.com/timholy/Images.jl) library. For example, one can import a raster image and plot it with Plots via the commands:

```julia
using Plots, Images
img = load("image.png")
plot(img)
```

PDF graphics can also be added to Plots.jl plots using `load("image.pdf")`. Note that Images.jl requires that the PDF color scheme is RGB.

## Shapes

*Save Gotham*

```@example input_data
using Plots

function make_batman()
    p = [(0, 0), (0.5, 0.2), (1, 0), (1, 2),  (0.3, 1.2), (0.2, 2), (0, 1.7)]
    s = [(0.2, 1), (0.4, 1), (2, 0), (0.5, -0.6), (0, 0), (0, -0.15)]
    m = [(p[i] .+ p[i + 1]) ./ 2 .+ s[i] for i in 1:length(p) - 1]

    pts = similar(m, 0)
    for (i, mi) in enumerate(m)
        append!(
            pts,
            map(BezierCurve([p[i], m[i], p[i + 1]]), range(0, 1, length = 30))
        )
    end
    x, y = Plots.unzip(Tuple.(pts))
    Shape(vcat(x, -reverse(x)), vcat(y, reverse(y)))
end

# background and limits
plt = plot(
    bg = :black,
    xlim = (0.1, 0.9),
    ylim = (0.2, 1.5),
    framestyle = :none,
    size = (400, 400),
    legend = false,
)
```

```@example input_data
# create an ellipse in the sky
pts = Plots.partialcircle(0, 2π, 100, 0.1)
x, y = Plots.unzip(pts)
x = 1.5x .+ 0.7
y .+= 1.3
pts = collect(zip(x, y))

# beam
beam = Shape([(0.3, 0.0), pts[95], pts[50], (0.3, 0.0)])
plot!(beam, fillcolor = plot_color(:yellow, 0.3))
```

```@example input_data
# spotlight
plot!(Shape(x, y), c = :yellow)
```

```@example input_data
# buildings
rect(w, h, x, y) = Shape(x .+ [0, w, w, 0, 0], y .+ [0, 0, h, h, 0])
gray(pct) = RGB(pct, pct, pct)
function windowrange(dim, denom)
    range(0, 1, length = max(3, round(Int, dim/denom)))[2:end - 1]
end

for k in 1:50
    local w, h, x, y = 0.1rand() + 0.05, 0.8rand() + 0.3, rand(), 0.0
    shape = rect(w, h, x, y)
    graypct = 0.3rand() + 0.3
    plot!(shape, c = gray(graypct))

    # windows
    I = windowrange(w, 0.015)
    J = windowrange(h, 0.04)
    local pts = vec([(Float64(x + w * i), Float64(y + h * j)) for i in I, j in J])
    windowcolors = Symbol[rand() < 0.2 ? :yellow : :black for i in 1:length(pts)]
    scatter!(pts, marker = (stroke(0), :rect, windowcolors))
end
plt
```

```@example input_data
# Holy plotting, Batman!
batman = Plots.scale(make_batman(), 0.07, 0.07, (0, 0))
batman = translate(batman, 0.7, 1.23)
plot!(batman, fillcolor = :black)
```

## [Extra keywords](@id extra_kwargs)

There are some features that are very specific to a certain backend or not yet implemented in Plots.
For these cases it is possible to forward extra keywords to the backend.
Every keyword that is not a Plots keyword will then be collected in a `extra_kwargs` dictionary.

This dictionary has three layers: `:plot`, `:subplot` and `:series` (default).
To which layer the keywords get collected can be specified by the `extra_kwargs` keyword.
If arguments should be passed at multiple layers in the same call or the keyword is already a valid Plots keyword, the `extra_kwargs` dictionary has to be constructed at the call site.
```julia
plot(1:5, series_keyword = 5)
# results in extra_kwargs = Dict( :series => Dict( series_keyword => 5 ) )
plot(1:5, colormap_width = 6, extra_kwargs = :subplot)
# results in extra_kwargs = Dict( :subplot => Dict( colormap_width = 6 ) )
plot(1:5, extra_kwargs = Dict( :series => Dict( series_keyword => 5 ), :subplot => Dict( colormap_width => 6 ) ) )
```

Refer to the [tracking issue](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/Plots.jl/issues/2648) to see for which backends this feature is implemented.
Which extra keywords the backend actually handles should be documented in the backend documentation.

!!! warning
    Using the extra keywords machinery will make your code backend dependent.
    Only use it for final tweaks. It is clearly a bad idea to use it in recipes.
